Overview 
========
This guide covers installation instructions and general information about the Zuki's Atlassian Plugin.

Why?
====
Why do I need to use an addon instead of downloading the app using the Apple App Store or Google Play?

* *Functionality* The addon allows you to intercept every event on your JIRA instance and unblock a great functionality: Push Notifications.
* *30-day-trial period* Using the Atlassian Marketplace you can test both, iOS and Android applications for free.
* *Administration* As a company you pay the service the same way as you pay your JIRA’s subscription.
* *Support* The Zuki development team will adapt Zuki in order to get it working on your organization without extra costs.
