Overview 
========
This guide covers installation instructions and general information about Zuki.

Why?
====
Why do  I need to use an addon instead of downloading the app using the Apple App Store or Google Play?

* Functionality. The addon allows you to intercept every event on your JIRA instance and unblock a great functionality: Push Notifications.
* 30-day-trial period. Using the Atlassian Marketplace you can test both, iOS and Android applications for free.
* Administration. As a company you pay the service the same way as you pay your JIRAâ€™s subscription.
* Support. The Zuki development team will adapt Zuki in order to get it working on your organization without extra costs.
